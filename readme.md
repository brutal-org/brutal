Striking modernist shapes and bold use of modern C are the hallmarks of <b>BRUTAL</b>.<br>
<b>BRUTAL</b> combines the desire of UNIX utopia from the 1970s with modern technology and engineering.

## About

**BRUTAL** is a micro-kernel base operating system targeting the x86_64 architecture. ARM and Risc-V support is planned.

## Build Instructions

You can find instructions about building BRUTAL [here](book/01-04-build.md).

## Roadmap

Right now the main goal of brutal is to run doom.

See the [roadmap](book/01-02-roadmap.md) file for more information on how we plan to get there and where you can contribute.

## Components

### Kernel

**BRUTAL** is based on a micro-kernel

### Library

**BRUTAL** feature a rich C library with custom allocators, data structures and algorithms.

Type-safe printf:

```c
log("the answer to {} the {} and {} is... {}", "life", "universe", "everything", 42);

> the answer to life the universe and everything is 42
```

Type-generic containers:

```c
typedef struct {int x; int y;} Point;
typedef Vec(Point) PointVec;

PointVec v;
vec_init(&v);
vec_push(&v, (Point){16, 32});

Point p;
vec_pop(&v, &p);

vec_deinit(&v);
```

## Modern C

Brutal is written in a dialect of C called modern C characterize by the following principle:

- Avoid pointers and prefer value semantic.
- The standard library is old and unsafe, **don't use it**.
- Don't be afraid of writing type generic code.
