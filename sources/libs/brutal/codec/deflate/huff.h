/*
 * Build a table for fast decoding of symbols from a Huffman code.  As input,
 * this function takes the codeword length of each symbol which may be used in
 * the code.  As output, it produces a decode table for the canonical Huffman
 * code described by the codeword lengths.  The decode table is built with the
 * assumption that it will be indexed with "bit-reversed" codewords, where the
 * low-order bit is the first bit of the codeword.  This format is used for all
 * Huffman codes in DEFLATE.
 *
 * @decode_table
 *	The array in which the decode table will be generated.  This array must
 *	have sufficient length; see the definition of the ENOUGH numbers.
 * @lens
 *	An array which provides, for each symbol, the length of the
 *	corresponding codeword in bits, or 0 if the symbol is unused.  This may
 *	alias @decode_table, since nothing is written to @decode_table until all
 *	@lens have been consumed.  All codeword lengths are assumed to be <=
 *	@max_codeword_len but are otherwise considered untrusted.  If they do
 *	not form a valid Huffman code, then the decode table is not built and
 *	%false is returned.
 * @num_syms
 *	The number of symbols in the code, including all unused symbols.
 * @decode_results
 *	An array which provides, for each symbol, the actual value to store into
 *	the decode table.  This value will be directly produced as the result of
 *	decoding that symbol, thereby moving the indirection out of the decode
 *	loop and into the table initialization.
 * @table_bits
 *	The log base-2 of the number of main table entries to use.
 * @max_codeword_len
 *	The maximum allowed codeword length for this Huffman code.
 *	Must be <= DEFLATE_MAX_CODEWORD_LEN.
 * @sorted_syms
 *	A temporary array of length @num_syms.
 *
 * Returns %true if successful; %false if the codeword lengths do not form a
 * valid Huffman code.
