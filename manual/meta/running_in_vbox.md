# How to run skiftOS on Virtual Box

## Preparing the host OS
1. Download the latest stable version of _Virtual Box_ for your host OS from [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) or any other _similar_ service.
2. Download the latest release `.img` file of skiftOS from [here](https://github.com/skiftOS/skift/releases/latest).
3. Rename the extension of the downloaded `.img` file from `.img` to `.hdd`.

> **NOTE:** Incase you are using windows, file extensions may not be displayed. Read this [guide](https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmanager/change-file-extension-windows-10.html) to enable extensions and then rename the file.

4. Great! You now have all the files required to run skiftOS
